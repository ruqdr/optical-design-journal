# Optical Design Learning Journal

A personal learning journal for optical lens design and optical system design principles. This repository serves as a dynamic textbook, workbook, and lab notebook where I document theory, track practical exercises, and build a portfolio of design work.

## Structure

- **[01_Geometric_Optics/](01_Geometric_Optics/)** – Fundamentals of ray tracing, Snell's law, simple lenses, and paraxial optics.
- **[02_Lens_Aberrations/](02_Lens_Aberrations/)** – Study of aberrations: spherical, coma, astigmatism, field curvature, distortion, and chromatic aberration.
- **[03_Optical_System_Design/](03_Optical_System_Design/)** – Design methodologies, system layout, optimization, tolerancing, and practical design examples.

## Resources

- **[Formulary.md](Formulary.md)** – Essential formulas and equations for optical design.
- **[Reading_List.md](Reading_List.md)** – Books, articles, tutorials, and software references.

## How to Use This Journal

1. Each chapter folder contains a **Chapter_Summary.md** (to be created) summarizing key concepts.
2. Exercises are posted as GitHub Issues with labels indicating chapter and topic.
3. Solutions are developed in topic branches and submitted via Pull Requests.
4. Merged Pull Requests close the corresponding issue and archive the solution in the main branch.

## Current Status

- Repository initialized with basic structure.
- First exercise to be defined soon.
