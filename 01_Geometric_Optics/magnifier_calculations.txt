# Exercise 1.1: Simple Magnifier Design

## Problem Statement
Design a plano-convex lens to act as a 5× magnifier (magnifying glass). Assume the eye is relaxed (image at infinity).

## Assumptions
- Glass: N‑BK7 (nd = 1.5168, Vd = 64.17)
- Thin‑lens approximation.
- Lens is plano‑convex: one flat surface (R2 = ∞), one convex surface (R1 = R).
- Angular magnification formula for relaxed eye: M = 25 cm / f.

## Calculations

### 1. Focal Length from Magnification
M = 5
f = 25 cm / M = 25 cm / 5 = 5 cm = 50 mm.

### 2. Lensmaker's Formula for Plano‑Convex Lens
1/f = (n - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)
Since R2 = ∞, 1/R2 = 0.
Thus: 1/f = (n - 1) / R
Rearranging: R = (n - 1) * f

### 3. Radius of Curvature
n = 1.5168
R = (1.5168 - 1) * 50 mm = 0.5168 * 50 mm = 25.84 mm.

## Result
Required radius of curvature for the convex surface: **R ≈ 25.8 mm** (rounded to one decimal).

## Design Parameters
- Focal length: 50 mm
- Glass: N‑BK7
- Lens shape: plano‑convex, convex side facing the object (or eye, depending on orientation).
- Center thickness: Not specified; thin‑lens approximation valid if thickness ≪ R.

## Notes
- For a real magnifier, the lens would be placed such that the object is at the focal point (f = 50 mm) from the lens.
- Chromatic aberration may be noticeable due to moderate dispersion (Vd = 64.17); achromatic doublet could be considered for improved performance.
